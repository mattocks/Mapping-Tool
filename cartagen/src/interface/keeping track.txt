Point:
initializes with:
	x coordinate, y coordinate, r (size of point), and parent shape (what shape it is part of)
	has a specific color, and is not being dragged.

draw function:
	if the parent shape is active, then it draws the points.
	also, if it's being dragged/hovered over/nothing, it keeps track and makes the point behave accordingly.

mouse inside:
	is the mouse inside a specific point?

base:
	default actions/traits, not doing anything important

click:
	if the mouse is in the point, and the active tool is not currently the pen tool, then the color changes. the parent 	shape becomes active, and the tool changes to the warp tool (ready for dragging)
	
hover:
	changes the color, not dragging.
	
drag:
	if the parent shape is active, change the coordinates accordingly as its being moved.
	
	
Shape: 
initializes with:
	this.active= is it active? (originally, no)
	this.points=an array of point objects (originally, empty)
	this.dragging=is it dragging? (originally, no)
	
new_point function:
	pushes a new point into its this.points array
	
mouse inside:
	is the mouse inside the current shape?

base: what to do when the shape is not doing anything
click: what to do when the shape is clicked.
hover: when hovering over the shape, change color. 

drag: when the shape is active and it's being dragged, then iterate through the array of points this.points, and change the value of all the points.
